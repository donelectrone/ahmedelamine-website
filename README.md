This repository contains the source code for my personal website and digital garden, located at [https://www.ahmedelamine.com](https://www.ahmedelamine.com).

## About This Project

This site serves as the central hub for my work as a Digital Craftsman and System Builder. It's the home for my projects, my thoughts, and the resources I create on my journey to engineer a more intentional life.

The site is built as a simple, static website using HTML and CSS, and it is deployed via Netlify.

## Brand Philosophy

The core philosophy of my brand is "The Intentional Canvas"â€”the idea that a well-lived life is not found, but is built with intention, skill, and well-designed tools.
