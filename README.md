This repository contains the source code for my personal website, digital garden, and portfolio of web applications, all hosted at [https://www.ahmedelamine.com](https://www.ahmedelamine.com).

## About This Project

This site serves as the central hub for my work as a Digital Craftsman and System Builder. It's the home for my projects, my thoughts, and the resources I create on my journey to engineer a more intentional life.

## Technical Philosophy

The entire site is built on the **JAMstack** architecture (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup).

*   **Markup:** The core structure is built with semantic HTML.
*   **Styling:** All styling is handled with modern, responsive CSS.
*   **JavaScript:** The interactive applications (like the AI Fitness Coach) are built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, leveraging modern browser APIs like IndexedDB for offline functionality.

This approach ensures the site and applications are fast, secure, and highly scalable. The project is deployed via a continuous integration pipeline on **Netlify**.

## Brand Philosophy

The core philosophy of my brand is "The Intentional Canvas"â€”the idea that a well-lived life is not found, but is built with intention, skill, and well-designed tools.
